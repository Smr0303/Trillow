# Real Estate NFT DApp

Trillow is a decentralized web application designed to facilitate seamless digital trading of real estate assets. It harnesses the  concept of Rentable NFTs, implemented using ERC4907 standards. This  enables users to effortlessly buy, sell, and list real estate properties in the form of NFT.
It also ensures that every transaction on Trillow is executed with the approval of all involved parties—lenders, buyers, sellers, and inspecting agents—ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.
